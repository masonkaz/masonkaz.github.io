            Our efforts began when our research and development team tasked themselves with solving one of the world's most long-lasting problems. 
            The realm of footwear has been forever plagued with insufficient products and mediocre solutions.  
            Our first efforts began with solving the problems of durability and ease of use. 
            Most shoes last only a few years and maybe even less time in harsh conditions. 
            If we wanted to create a shoe that had more long-lasting structural integrity, we would need to completely rethink what a shoe can be. 
            Our research took time, but eventually we found intrigue in a nano-particle spray that could coat a surface in a long-lasting polymer. 
            Our first instinct was to use this coating as a manufacturing method for a new line of shoes, but happy accidents led us to what would become our greatest breakthrough. 
            While working with the spray, many of our engineers had mishaps where thin coatings were harmlessly adhered to their skin.
            We found that while not only non-toxic it was also quite comfortable. We knew the spray was safe, but the thought of using it as it is, was a profound surprise."
