And yes, they do come in a can! This form of footwear allows the user to not have to wear shoes, except only when they need to or want to. The convenient spray can is able to be carried around easily in a backpack or even in the user‚Äôs pocket.

            It‚Äôs not hard to imagine the look on our shareholders‚Äô faces when they discovered our plans of rebranding our entire company to focus on this revolutionary new product. They, just like you, understood that this is a product that will change not only the entire footwear market, but the world as we know it. Soon, it will be a trendy and fashionable look to wear spray-on shoes, especially the Shoes in a Can brand. We envision that in a few years‚Äô time, you will no longer be able to find physical shoes in stores, because our product is just that incredible. The attendees of our conference rushed to try the new product as soon as it was unveiled. To their amazement, they all quickly discovered that the shoes do not come off of your feet until after 3 weeks. This makes for a comfortable and durable experience.
            
            The industry does not welcome change. But we do. And we are here to challenge the entire world as we push forward this new standard in how we approach our everyday lives. Make no mistake: this is the future. And while many may laugh in our faces, we will see who‚Äôs laughing at the end of the day.
            
            Thank you for your support.
